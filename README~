About:
This repository is for my 3rd year projects for
an MEng Electronic Engineering degree at the 
University of Southampton.

The project brief will change as time goes on 
so read the dated updates below...

At the moment I know I want to construct a 
quadrocopter but full functionailty is unkown.
A few features I will need to include are...

	-Remote control via a wireless linkup. 	
	This will most likely be achieved with
	a full duplex comms system that will 
	relay a large amount of data for 
	control systems and sensors

	-Control systems relised in software
	that will allow the copter to move in 
	3D space

	-*Extended functionality* AI aspect
	that could potentially be very 
	but incredibly challenging
